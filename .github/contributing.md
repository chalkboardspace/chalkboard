## Open an Issue

[Open an Issue](../../../issues/new) to report any problems or improvements. When necessary, use some online service like [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), to show the problem. Be sure to include some description to explain the problem.

## Submit a Pull Request

To submit a new feature, make sure that changes are done to the source code. [Follow our style guide](#style-guide) and do not forget the tests.

Try to solve a problem for each pull request, this increases the chances of acceptance. When in doubt, open a [new issue](#open-an-issue) so we can answer you. Look existing issues for ideas or to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.
